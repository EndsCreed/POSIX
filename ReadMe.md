# POSIX Repo

### Info

---

This repo will contain all projects, labs, and notes related to POSIX stores as different branches. Labs, assignments, and projects will go here. I intend to use this as both a way to submit labs and a way to store my code as a portfolio.

There are almost always multiple main methods in Labs so the .c files must be compiled individually which the CMakeLists.txt in that branch should allow for.

### Software

---

All branches are compiled using CMake with STANDARD_C99 and I compile them individually. This should be achievable with the configurations drop down in CLion

I use CLion as my IDE so cloning these branches into CLion with VCS should allow these projects to work right out of the box.
